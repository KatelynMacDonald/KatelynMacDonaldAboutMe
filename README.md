My name is Katelyn MacDonald and I am currently a senior at Tecumseh High school. I am currently in the computer science course at the Southern Indiana Career & Technical Center in Evansville, Indiana. I am planning on attenting Purdue University to major in computer science and follow a track into artificial intelligence. I am hoping to have a career in the AI field or work for NASA.
